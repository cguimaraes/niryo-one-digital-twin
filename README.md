# Digital Twin Application @ 5G-DIVE Project
This repository comprises the code developed and integrated in 5G-DIVE project
in order to implement the Digital Twin use case.

Currently, this use case uses the [Niryo One](https://niryo.com/niryo-one/)
robot arm and the [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) robot
simulator.

## Version
 - 0.1.0beta1

## Requirements
 - Ubuntu 16.04 (or newer version - 18.04, 20.04)
 - PTPD (if you want distributed deployment between multiple hosts)
 - Docker
 - Docker compose

## Getting Started
 ### Digital Twin service description
 The Digital Twin [service](./digital-twin-service/) is composed of 6 different modules:
 - ROS master: The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the modules in the Digital Twin service (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/ros-master/)).
 - ROS Drivers: Porvides the basic sensor and actuator functionalities of the robot arm (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/niryo-one-drivers/)).
 - Robot Stack: The robot stack composed of Control, Motion Planning and Interface modules. (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/niryo-one-stack/)).
 - Digital Replica: Provides the virtual object that replicates the behavior of the Niryo One robot arm (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/digital-replica/)).
 - Web interface: GUI for remote operation (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/web-interface/)).
 - Replay feature: Replays last 30 seconds of the robot remote operation in a separate virtual object. (detailed info [here](./digital-twin-service/replay-feature/)).
 ### Install Requirements
 - Install fresh Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 or 20.04 Desktop (in a VM or as native OS)
 - Install Docker Engine (tutorial [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/))
 - Install Docker Compose (tutorial [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
 - Clone this git repo 
 
 ### Run Digital Twin service
 - The scenarios [folder](./scenarios/) is composed of different deployment options for the Digital Twin service.
    - single host scenarios (tutorial [here](./scenarios/single-host-scenario/))
    - multiple hosts scenarios (tutorial [here](./scenarios/multi-host-scenario/)) ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)
    - 5g-dive scenario (tutorial [here](./scenarios/5g-dive/))
