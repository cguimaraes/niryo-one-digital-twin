20ms - robot sensor data
50 samples / s

60 seconds => 3000

/mystorage/sample/0 => value
/mystorage/sample/1
/mystorage/sample/2
...
/mystorage/sample/3000


idx => current sample id

// Receive data from the robot
write(/mystorage/sample/cid, value)
cid = (cid + 1) % 3000

// First robot => store data
get(/mystorage/sample/*)


in case you can also structure thinkgs like

/mystorage/<minute ID>/<sample ID>

to get things for minute

or per slot of seconds, etc.

/mystorage/<minute ID>/<second ID>/<sample ID>/value


to get everything in the last minute /mystorage/current minut/*/*


parse the data line by line
